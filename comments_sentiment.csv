It was one of the better decisions that I&#39;ve made in the past. This Xiaomi Mi 11 looks amazing anyways but my OCD-trait doesn&#39;t like the camera on the top left of the screen. My Mi 9T Pro has a full screen as well, with better looking corners and a selfie-camera that slides out of the top of the phone. I guess the Mi 11 doesn&#39;t have the sliding camera anymore and that&#39;s why it&#39;s implemented in the screen itself... Everything has it&#39;s pro&#39;s and it con&#39;s of course. But if you&#39;d ask me to pick a next phone, i&#39;d still consider the sliding out camera-phone with full screen over the full-screen-phone with black dot from camera in the screen itself.

"Here&#39;s my take on the no charger included with your new phone, that apparently became the &quot;standard&quot; overnight..<br><br>I absolutely fucin hate it! And as most of us have figured out by now, it&#39;s OBVIOUSLY only about saving money and earning quite a bit extra on top of that for these tech giants, the environment actually will suffer from this.<br><br>But other than that, why do I hate it? Well..<br><br>1. People switch between different brands, most (as far as I can tell) don&#39;t stay with one brand for 10 years, apart from apple sheep&#39;s, but they still get sacked by dear, dear T.Crocked leader. And when you change brand the new phone doesn&#39;t necessarily work with the new charger even though both phones have USB-C connectors. Also the old charger is probably charging at 5-10 W so you&#39;d like an upgrade regardless.<br><br>2. What about new costumers Apple, Samsung and the rest, huh?! You do realize new people are born everyday right..? And that these people are going to buy their first phones one day. And that day is right now, because previously born are in their teens now or in their three&#39;s or five&#39;s 😂 coz that&#39;s apparently when you get your first phone these days for a lot of middle class and above western kids at least.<br><br>3. Here&#39;s an interesting fact.. Yes, you can sorta buy one USB-C charger for everything now, if it&#39;s of the right type and power output, though many laptops still use and/or require a proprietary charger. However, maybe I don&#39;t want to charge everything at the maximum rate, or let&#39;s say that I am a person that once every year or more often, manage to leave behind a charger in a hotel room, because I was stressed to make it to the airport on time. Maybe I&#39;ll be pretty fucin screwed if I don&#39;t have an extra! So guess what? I always buy at least one extra charger to every phone I buy. That means that I have to buy at least two chargers now with every new phone, and they ain&#39;t exactly  super cheap. So I&#39;d say.. one charger in the box isn&#39;t even something to be questioned. And an extra at almost no cost, should be offered with a new phone purchase. Not only for the mentioned &quot;leave it behind&quot; case above, but simply for convenience. Like having one at your workplace for example, or at your getaway summer cabin. Or perhaps just having one in a different room.<br><br>Hey! you know what.. that&#39;s the new standard! TWO CHARGERS INCLUDED! BOOOM!

I ordered one and it should come in next week or so. Very excited to have the mi 11 for a daily driver. I&#39;m on the k30 ultra for the passed weeks now and I have to say it is wonderful to have a company wich makes products like this for these prices. I&#39;ve always been a Samsung fan but they are way up there with Apple on their pricing. I really do not like those extreme prices. I am not impressed with what i am getting for that kind of money. Way to much money for just a phone. Xiaomi delivers way more for less in my opinion. And miui 12 is so much richer than One ui will ever be.

$700 suddenly became a mid range phone ?? offering a cheap plastic fake leather back finish for $700 is OK??? Dude i know you are rich but please know your audience and the needs of the people.. being a tech guy and giving some random review that is not in tune with the expectations of the people is really bad.. Mi phone USP is less price with high end specs. last time i can think of an MI phone that was mid range was MI 9T pro.. Ther is no brainer in buying any android phone with a price tag of $700 when that could fetch you an iPhone. THe environment and all the apps in iphone are way smoother compared to these other android phones topped with their shitty UI.

"I honestly really wanna see flip phones like the Z flip become more accessible and have a low budget option. For some reason I really like the idea and I think it could be improved upon in a lot of ways like making a better outside screen for widgets or more comfortable folding mechanics. I realize they’re not for everyone and by no means practical yet, but I like that they’re compact and would honestly be something that could pull me away from apple. I’ve had an iphone xs since a little bit after they launched and I still love it. The jump to mostly screen was a big one for a casual tech person like me, and I still feel like my xs is fairly new and it definitely runs well. I’m mainly just interested in watching how phones play out through the years before I really need a new one. If anyone reading this has a z flip or something similar, do you enjoy using it day-to-day? Do you actually use the flip feature that often, or do you wish you had just gotten a regular phone?

"Voting with your wallet regarding chargers. Do you believe this to be the case? I&#39;m pretty sure that dropping 900 or more on a phone, people don&#39;t care about spending 50 more on a charger. They accept it because they want the phone. If they&#39;d have kept the charger but upped the price 5%, they would also still get it. When you have the money to spend you don&#39;t care. Honestly I don&#39;t care because I&#39;m not that affluent. I&#39;m sure if companies were to do this for the more mid-range phones (where there is more competition, apple not included) you would see an impact. The companies have figured out how to cost-cut (in their flagship offering no less) with dropping the charger and the people don&#39;t mind it. There is no board meeting in my mind where anyone would say &quot;it&#39;s clear people want the charger, our sales are down by 10%&quot;.

"I&#39;m looking most forward to the midrange phones. They are getting good, fast. For me the A72 is interesting. Advantages over flagships: dual sim and micros support, headphones jack, price. With flagships I am looking forward to smartphones that get the balance between camera software and hardware right. Advantage of the flagships are more performance and wireless charging. Would like to see wireless charging standards on midrange. The technology is ubiquitous and cheap these days. For me Pureview is the benchmark. And good macros with the image sensors. If they can maintain pureview quality in the larger than 40mpix sensors I think the phones brands are on track. I expected this with the Samsung midrange phones of the last two years, but the results seem disappointing, arguably due to hardware/software mismatching due to pricing. That&#39;s a huge waste of good hardware tech if true and a scandal if you ask me. And I finally hope to see Samsung get rid of beautify mode on all their phones or at least provide an option for a true image mode. Beautify mode is ruining the quality of the image on both front and back, despite the increase in megapixels. There&#39;s a mismatch going on here, I have valid value concerns of poorer image quality for the value and performance of the camera.","{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9648}"

"your reviews are too personal bro, and you only seem to voice your own opinion most of time, you dont represent the community. i understand you have particular taste but its not same with all of us.<br><br>1) i like slight curve to displays, not overdoing it but also i dont want it gone, especially in this segment, i want the curve, maybe there can be an option to not have one but i want the option to have one (i am talking about edge curve not corner curve, i hate corner curves)<br><br>2) i dont want a plastic back, no matter how premium or cheap, i am super fine with metal tho, i also have a oneplus 5T and the metal and the slim profile feels just so good to hold and look at, glass is okay, but its too much to care to not break, idk why people ditched metal but metal is the best. or glass is fine atleast when it comes to glass vs plastic<br><br>3) we wont pay extra for a charger, its stupid, just include charger in box and put an option by default to not shipping with one, but keep an option to get one along for free.. the win here is by doing that, xiaomi is not cutting off the charger cost from the phone, so if u dont order the charger along for free, you are still paying for it, but if u dont care anyway its fine, people who know what they want will tick the box. again, I DONT WANNA PAY A PENNY EXTRA FOR CHARGER. <br><br>ps: important thing for companies to note, the chargers and cables die out before the phone, so maybe some generic chargers might be around in an example household.. but in reality we always need a charger and a good supported fast charging cable too with every new purchase. i have 3 phones 2 of them are flagship and i have changed charger and cable atleast twice while using phones. its not true we have chargers lying around, and lying around chargers arent up there with new tech being released every new iteration. even if i had a 30w charger lying around, with my new purchase i still want a 55w meta charger, why tf would i not want in box?","{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9867}"

"I doubt the “box choice” will make its way to the global announcement; after all, if the incentive for companies is to reduce expenses on shipping costs it makes sense to pave ahead of the decision locally in China as a “eco-friendly choice” where the shipping difference is negligible anyway, and then generalize that decision to the global market where the savings of a smaller box are much more significant.

"As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.<br>He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”<br>The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.<br>Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?<br>Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.<br><br>Be a listener if you enjoyed the story plz do Subscride my channel, I have to reach 1k.<br><br>It takes only 5 seconds and make my day, Thank you and I am sure you will love my content...............😊","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9253}"

Less ram, less internal storage, screen burn in, micro-scratches in the back. Chips and dents on the sides. Besides burn in on the screen no other issue on the screen.<br><br>But the s21u has a lot of advantages.

"Literally it is bs that these companies are not including a charger with the phone anymore lol. Like, that is an essential necessity to power the device. It isn&#39;t about &quot; saving the enviorment &quot; it&#39;s about saving an extra $5 in production costs, and turning around and making a $50 profit from someone buying the charger they need as an extra. When you buy the charger seperate, it&#39;ll come in it&#39;s own packaging right? It&#39;s own box, opposed to being included in a box already. That literally creates MORE waste lmao, how tf they boutta so boldly lie to our faces about why they&#39;re doing it, when it legit doesn&#39;t even make since as to why they&#39;re doing it. Apple stays having to always fuck things up. They need to compensate on taking things away. We&#39;re paying the same amount, but getting less altogether. Everyone wants to make their own wireless buds these days, include them in the box or some shit. I mean, up until 2 years ago we always got headphones with our phones, imo it makes the total product less desirable. Less valuable. Wwyd if you bought a car but you had to buy the gas tank seperate?

Of course for a youtuber such as you these things won&#39;t matter, so you will accept whatever price point they will throw at you, and you&#39;ll thank them, every time. Zero critical thinking.

Seriously, zero critical thinking. <br><br>Why it never happens that you say &quot;hey, this phone for this price? Not recommended, it&#39;s too much&quot;.

This phone at 620 bucks is not as polished as a Samsung for the same price. These phones should cost around 500 bucks, so no, 620 bucks for this phone is not a great price, and you should say that. &quot;The new normal&quot; my ass.

"I wanted to buy a new phone for almost three years now; I&#39;m still on the OnePlus 5. But since there was no big (functional) revolution in tech during this time (*cough* 5G *cough*), I wanted to wait for the next big step in smartphone history, which for me is clearly the under display camera; I don&#39;t there will be anything revolutionary after this for a while. But as you may know, we have so far only seen one phone including this tech within this time period, which was also not very great. So I am still waiting, because now at the latest it would be rather stupid to buy another phone, since the udc has already been introduced to the smartphone market, which makes chances that we see more of these this or at latest next year. I was first hoping for the OnePlus 9 (Pro) to have it, but the a couple of leaks came up; I know, leaks are leaks, but they were all kinda similar, so I guess there won&#39;t be an udc in the 9 (Pro); maybe the 9T. So now I am hopefully looking towards Google, since they recently patented an udc technology too and I hope they&#39;ll put it in the Pixel 6 already.","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.6223}"

"I think &quot;voting with your wallet&quot; is just not happening in the high end space, people are going to buy that stuff just because it is the best X brand offers and next year they are going to be like &quot;removing the charger didn&#39;t impact our (high end) sales so we removed them from every product&quot; and with that we are going to remove them from every product.<br>This just screams for cheap knock off chargers to explode even more (probaply in the literal sense). And while even low end tech still gets better, something like this will always impact the lowest class most. My mom for example tries to be pretty concious about her tech but she still manages to loose/break her charger every  1 or 2 years but she at least has me to hook her up with a not terrible replacement, others might be not as  lucky and if all you can afford is a sub 200  phone but it doesnt&#39;t  come with a charger you are not going to spend big bucks on a dedicated one if you need one and if you get up unlucky it might fry your phone and then you are off so much worse","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.6079}"
